Lionel Di Giacomo

*Forked Headway-Example-Block repository
*Changed Filename of main PHP file, Began work going 
  through and customizing block files

*Plans before v0.1:
  -Get basic link-block functionality working
  -Register at least some options in headway to customize the overlay
  
*Goals for v1.0:
  -Ensure cross-browser functionality
  -Code in failsafe (transparant .png, display:none hover functionality) 
     for cases where the overlay won't work
  -Register suite of options in HeadWay visual editor:
     =Hiding overlay on touch/mobile interfaces
     =Customize color/image/transparency of overlay directly in HeadWay
     =Customize transition effect
     =Enable various failsafes
     =Customization for Block Title
     =Ability to edit Block Content

*Possible Goals:
  -Extending the block display into gutters, up to 50% a gutter width
     to creaate tighter mosaics
  -Changing shape/using masks (Probably must disable block title)
